This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The applications is an equipment registry where users can register and then have a QR code generated which can later be printed and attached to a piece of equipment. When scanned this should return the contact information of the registered user in cases where the piece of equipment is lost and recovered by someone else. This is mainly a proof of concept to test out the concept of a virtual lost and found first suggested to me by my father in law.

## Getting Started

* Setup a node environment using [these generated instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download) `I recommend using Node.js @ v22 LTS + <your_platform :- linux/macos/windows> + nvm + npm`

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
